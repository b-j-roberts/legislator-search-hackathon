      "snippet": "look at this , republican congressman jefferson shreve made 625 trades last year totaling more than $150nthal, republican mike mccaul each traded about $80 million worth and ro khanna made more than 4,000 trades and we can't forget nancy pelosi just $5 million in trades last year, but way moreover her decades in congress. it's all legal, but in the court of public opinion, the opportunity to profit off of information does a trust in government so today congress again will try to ban themselves from trading stocks but it's an up hill climb. if styles bill can get to a full floor vote in the house, there's no certainty the senate will even pick it up, stuart. stuart: thanks, lauren. house oversight committee chair james comer joins me now about this stock trading by congress. forgive me, congressman. i've got a proposal. what if there was a congressional database, clearly stating any trade that lawmakers make and reported immediately in roll time, so we all know exactly what everybody is doing. what's wrong with that? >> well i don't think anything is wrong with that. i would support that.",
