      "snippet": "senators brian schatz and tammy duckworth senator schatz helps create the pro federal housing program which rewards jurisdictions that increase supply of affordable housing by correcting exclusionary zoning and land use policies. we know there is a lot more work to do here, but this is an incredibly important policy. he also co-authored the bipartisan act which encourages localities to cut owners regulations and make it easier to build. senator duckworth has been a strong advocate for safe and affordable housing for the most vulnerable. as the assistant secretary for veterans affairs, she worked to end veteran homelessness and in the senate she fought for new funding to support and modernize public housing. both represent the kind of leadership our country lead -- needs right now, looking for solutions to this crucial problem and i am so grateful that they are here. i would like to welcome you to the stage.
