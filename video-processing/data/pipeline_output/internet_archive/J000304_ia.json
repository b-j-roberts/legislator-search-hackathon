      "snippet": "there was no abnormality, which actually doesn't correlate with what doctor ronny jackson told the public in 2018 when he disclosed that the president had a similar ct scan that showed the presence of coronary calcium, which is a marker of coronary artery disease. so the, i'm i'm almost less concerned about the actual, cause of the president's bruising. we can talk about that, than i am about why the the white house medical team has felt the need to study him in the last few months. what symptoms? what clinical concerns have prompted this? because the president is right. when you test the president of the united states, it creates a lot of concern, and rightfully so. >> the what the president said about the about aspirin, which has gotten a lot of attention, taking more aspirin than what his doctors are recommending and his rationale for doing so, which is he said, quotote, they say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and i don't want thick blood pouring through my heart. i want nice thin blood pouring through my heart. does that make sense? does that make sense? >> that makes no ",
