      "snippet": "lauren: yeah, but democrats including seth magazine say the bill doesn't go far enough. >> we were alln members of congress owning and trading stocks, the american people were expecting that. i'm sure that many members are promising to their constituents that's what they support like an actual ban on members owning and trading stocks. lauren: there's a lot of trading stocks going on on capitol hill. look at this , republican congressman jefferson shreve made 625 trades last year totaling more than $150 million of stocks. democrat richard blumenthal, republican mike mccaul each traded about $80 million worth and ro khanna made more than 4,000 trades and we can't forget nancy pelosi just $5 million in trades last year, but way moreover her decades in congress. it's all legal, but in the court of public opinion, the opportunity to profit off of information does a trust in government so today congress again will try to ban themselves from trading stocks but it's an up hill climb. if styles bill can get to a full floor vote in the house, there's no certainty the senate will even pick it up,",

      "snippet": "and i now yield one minute to representative seth magaziner. >> thank you very much, mr. clyburn. mr. speaker, do not let anyone rewrite the history of what happened on january 6th, 2021, a mob tried to overturn a free and fair election and deny the american people of our god given right to choose our own leaders. they attacked police officers with pipes, rocks and other weapons. it was domestic terrorism. call it what it is. they did it because president trump lied to them and repeatedly said that he did not lose the election when he, in fact, did. democracy only survives when leaders put the will of the people ahead of their own selfish ambition. and when the rule of law is enforced, we thank the hundreds of brave police officers who put their lives in harm's way to defend the capitol and our democracy. they know what it means to be patriotic americans, and their courage stands in sharp contrast to many of the republican members of this congress, who are too cowardly to tell the truth about what really happened on january 6th. we deserve leaders who stand for the constitution st",
